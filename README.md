## **Planning**
### **Target Audiences:**
* Adults who enjoy playing the sub genre of video games called “cosy games” but don’t want anything too taxing.
* Fans of the Stardew Valley. Which Is A Cult Cosy Game With A Large Player Base
* Casual Gamers who would like to spend time away from their main game and spend some time on a semi-concentrated task.
* Fans of nostalgic kids cards games like Snap or Uno. 
### **User Stories:**
* I as a user, want to be able to play a cute/nosalgic game with the ability to go to harder levels.
* I as a user, want to be able to track the progress of each round in some way.
* I as a user, want to be able to find a clear explanation of the game rules and how to play.
* As a user, I want to be able to navigate my way to resources easily.
* As a user, I want to learn more about the inspiration game.
### **Aims:**
* To provide a cute and nostalgic memory game.
* Be accessible to the visually impaired with good contrasts. 
* Provide a “how-to-play” section.
* Link to inspiration source 
* keyboard functions?
* To be an enjoyable distraction to fill the user's time.
### **How to Achieve:**
* The game will be free to use, and no sign up required.
* Site will use imagery and wording from the theme source and possible sound effects?
* Ensuring the use of semantic elements, alternate text, and aria labels where appropriate.
* The landing page will be the main menu. Access to the main menu can also be done throughout the game with the Nav button. This menu will contain links back to:
   1. Game rules.
   2. Game options menu.
   3. Keyboard Play?
* After each move, the relevant tally will be modified. Overall game play will be scored.
### **Wireframes**

### **Design**
* The over all design theme for this game came from the cult classic game of "Stardew Valley" a farming sim that was relised in 2014. This game has a huge following and has sold over 10 million copies. The bright and nostalgic pixel art is pleasing to look at and the icons in the game lend themselves to this type of spin-off game. 
#### *Color Scheme*
* I used the loading image (seen below) and added in other complmentary colours to create a colour pallete and then used . I am planning to only use #fff and #000 for writing to increase asseibility.

#### *Typography*
* Whilst doing research into the best Google Font combinations, I came across this article: [21 Google Fonts Combinations For Websites & Brands](https://www.garett.co/21-google-fonts-combinations-for-websites-brands). The Teko + Montserrat combination seemed to be the best suited to the aesthetic of the page. Plus, their readability is very good, so this is a plus for the accessibility of the website.
## **Universal Features**
### **Header Element**
#### *Logo*
* 
#### *Nav Bar*
* I wanted to add a traditional Navigation bar at the top of my website so the user could easily get from one page to another. 

* The hover feature was employed to turn the lettering from white to black to make sure the user is aware that this is an active link which they can click.

### **Hero Image**
* The Hero Image, or Background Image for this website is the loading screen of the actual game itself. Screenshot below. All images were taken from the Games Wiki which states that the content is available under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike unless otherwise noted. [Creative Commons Link](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/). Due to the fact this will be a none profitable game and is free to use, all images can be freely copies, redistributed, modified and used.

### **Footer**
* For good UX I kept with a traditional website footer of social media links. This is clean and simple and is universal throughout the website. This pared down footer is a key part of the continuity of the website.
* There is also a copyright - because I liked the addition.

### **References**
* Whilst I did try to deviate as much as possible, this project was influenced by 
* I would also like to mention that, before starting this project, I did research javascript build of memory card games, for both code inspiration and direction. Whilst no code was directly taken from these other projects, I can say that my research did influence how I built the project initially - hwoever strong deviations were taken after my research and the initial build. (Notable mentions: YOUTUBE VIDEOS ON THE BUILDS)
* I did rely on StackOverflow, W3schools, CSS-TRICKS and MDN web docs for general references and problem solving throughout the project.

### **Media**

## **Deployment**
* I deployed the page on GitHub pages via the following procedure: -
* From the project's repository, go to the Settings tab.
* From the left-hand menu, select the Pages tab.
* Under the Source section, select the Main branch from the drop-down menu and click Save.

## **During Development Testing**
During the development process, I was manually testing in the following ways:-
1. Manually testing each element for appearance and responsiveness via a simulated live server using an extension in VSCode.
1. Asked a Data Scientist friend to review the pages and the games responsiveness often they had no comments on improvements that could be made to the website in the timeframe.
### ***Manual Testing:***
* During testing, I used three browsers to ensure cross-compatibility. The browsers used were:
  1. Chrome
  2. Firefox  
  4. Edge
* I then used the devtools to simulate different screen sizes/devices from 320px up to 2200px in width. 
* In addition to this, I used the dev tools to simulate different products such as the iPhone XR, iPhone 12 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S8+, iPad Air, iPad Mini, Surface Pro 7 and Nest Hub.
* I also got friends and my partner to test the site on their own devices - Samsung, Dell Laptops, Self-built desktops and Apple products. 
### ***Bugs and Fixes:***
Below is a list of bugs I found during the development process. A lot of the bugs and fixes where minor enough that temporary editing in the devtools allowed me to find a quick and simple solutions to most of the bugs almost instantly. But here are a few that stumped me enough to write them down.
1. **Intended Outcome** - For the Nav button to show up in the top right of the screen and dropdown to show the other links to pages,
    * ***Issue Found:*** 
        * The hover over function at first did not work, and then also floated over the top of the button instead of droping down below the nav button,
    * ***Solution Used:*** 
        * Chaning the positioning and then the using the float function then got the button to stay in the top right corner. Then I also changed the contents css stylign to display: none and position: absolute instead of relative. This fixed the issue.

### **Accessability**
In addition to other tests, I was also inspired to use [WAVE - Web accessibility evaluation tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) by dnlbowers to check my pages for accessibility. no errors were returned - I was especially concerned with the contrast of my signup page but beforehand I had increased the font-weight and size, so this was mitigated.
