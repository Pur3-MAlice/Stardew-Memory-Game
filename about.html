        <h3>What is Stardew Valley?</h3>
        <p>Stardew Valley is a RPG (roleplaying game) that simulates country life.</p>
        <p>You leave the sole-sucking world of your corporate 9-5 and decide to breathe new life into your grandfather's farm, which he recently left you in his will.</p>
        <p>The player then creates a characters and moves to their new farm in Stardew Valley. Where they can build relationships (even marry!) the local townsfolk, farm crops and animals, go down the mines and battle monsters, or spend time whiling away the hours fishing. And as the seasons pass more adventures rear their heads!</p>
        
        <h3>Who Made Stardew Valley?</h3>
        <p>Stardew Valley was single headedly made by ConcernedApe (Eric Barone), over the course of 4.5 years. He created the art, music, and coded everything in C#</p>
        <p>Barone was heavily inspired by Harvest Moon, but found that the game lacked in some areas. To practice his own coding skills after University, Barone set out to remake Harvest Moon. Little did he know at the time that 4.5 years later he would single headedly publish what has been cited as one of the "greatest video games if all time".</p>
